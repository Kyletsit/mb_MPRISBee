# mb_MPRISBee plugin NOT FINISHED, NOT WORKING
A MusicBee plugin that sends player status to [mprisbee-bridge](https://github.com/Kyletsit/mprisbee-bridge) for MPRIS integration. Setup instructions are in that repo's README.

The idea to call syscalls in raw assembly is from [wine-discord-ipc-bridge](https://github.com/0e4ef622/wine-discord-ipc-bridge)
